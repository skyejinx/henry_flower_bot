Most Important Files: 
* corpus : Full corpus and each element as plain text. Note: Sources include Project Guettenberg and Google Books. 
* markov_object.py : Takes files and generates markov-chain sentences with them.
    -- A ton of help from https://github.com/epilanthanomai/markov
    -- To Dos: Be more heavy-handed with probabilities, more efficient was to handle the user's input
* user_supervision.py : Takes a sentence and returns the subject, object, and verbs
* joyce_supervised.py : Samples from the Joyce corpus and controls how, based on the sample, the output should behave. 
* word2vec_basic.py : All about the corpus with Word2Vec. Nothing terribly complicated or far from the tutorial just yet.  

General To Dos: 
* Rules revisions for Joyce content
* Implement the rules
* GUI
* Other web things
